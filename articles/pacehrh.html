</h3>
<p>The PACE-HRH model simulates healthcare needs in a given population
to enable better health system staffing decisions. PACE-HRH is a
stochastic, Monte Carlo simulation model, meaning that the population,
its healthcare needs, and the time required to meet those are simulated
and there is randomness built into the model uncertainty in the
population’s size, growth, and healthcare needs. To configure the model,
you input data in Excel spreadsheets that describe the population’s
demographics, healthcare tasks, and available staff in the geographic
region of interest. To begin, navigate to the “config” directory and
open the Excel workbook “model_inputs.xlsx”.</p>
<p>The workbook is initially configured to model a simple set of tasks
and contains example values. You should edit the workbook parameters for
the particular context you are working in.</p>
<p>The sections below describe each of the spreadsheets that are used as
model inputs. You will see each of these sheets in tabs across the
bottom of the Excel workbook.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="scenarios">Scenarios<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#scenarios"></a>
</h4>
<p>The <strong>Scenarios</strong> sheet is the primary sheet that
controls inputs to the model. Every row is a separate scenario and lists
the different healthcare scenarios that you’d like to model. You may
vary parameters in each scenario to compare different proposed
healthcare staffing options by changing the relevant values or the tab
specified to be used. For example, the default values hold the
demographic and seasonality parameters consistent across scenarios but
vary the healthcare tasks and staffing cadres to model proposed health
system policies.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="parameters">Parameters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#parameters"></a>
</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>UniqueID</strong>: The name of the scenario to model. The
name must be unique and will be used to name the results output files
after the simulation runs. This can be any useful description, but
should not include special characters.</li>
<li>
<strong>WeeksPerYr</strong>: The number of working weeks in the
year, excluding time off and absenteeism. For example, if a typical
worker has 2 weeks of vacation and is absent 3 weeks per year, then this
value would be 52-2-3=47.</li>
<li>
<strong>HrsPerWeek</strong>: The number of hours each week a typical
healthcare worker is expected to work, excluding breaks and on-call
time. This should typically be less than 40.</li>
<li>
<strong>BaselinePop</strong>: The number of people in a typical
healthcare catchment. Usually, these values are set as targets by a
government healthcare program, such as the size of the population each
primary healthcare facility is expected to serve. Value typically range
from 5,000 to 20,000.</li>
<li>
<strong>o_PopGrowth</strong> Typically this should be set to TRUE.
Optionally, this true/false binary value turns on or off the growth of
the population. If set to TRUE, the population size will grow at a rate
dependent on the fertility and mortality (set elsewhere). If set to
FALSE, the population pyramid will evolve per the fertility and
mortality, but the total population will be normalized to the
<strong>BaselinePop</strong> value every year, stabilizing population
size. This is to be used for debugging and sensitivity analysis.</li>
<li>
<strong>o_Seasonality</strong> Typically this should be set to TRUE.
Optionally, this true/false binary value turns on or off the
seasonality. If set to TRUE, seasonality curves will be applied to the
relevant tasks (set elsewhere). If set to FALSE, seasonality will be
turned off. This is to be used for debugging and sensitivity
analysis.</li>
<li>
<strong>o_Fertility_decr</strong> Typically this should be set to
TRUE. Optionally, this true/false binary value turns on or off the
decline in the fertility rate. If set to TRUE, fertility rates will
decline over time (set elsewhere). If set to FALSE, fertility will
remain stable at the level set for the first year of the simulation.
This is to be used for debugging and sensitivity analysis.</li>
<li>
<strong>o_MHIVTB_decr</strong> Typically this should be set to TRUE.
Optionally, this true/false binary value turns on or off the decline in
the incidence rates for malaria, HIV, and TB. If set to TRUE, incidence
rates will decline over time (set elsewhere). If set to FALSE, these
rates will remain stable at the level set for the first year of the
simulation. This is to be used for debugging and sensitivity
analysis.</li>
<li>
<strong>o_ChildDis_decr</strong> Typically this should be set to
TRUE. Optionally, this true/false binary value turns on or off the
decline in the incidence rates for childhood diseases. If set to TRUE,
incidence rates will decline over time (set elsewhere). If set to FALSE,
these rates will remain stable at the level set for the first year of
the simulation. This is to be used for debugging and sensitivity
analysis.</li>
<li>
<strong>sheet_</strong> columns K through N: The name of the sheets
to use as inputs for <strong>TaskValues</strong>,
<strong>PopValues</strong>, <strong>SeasonalityCurves</strong>, and
<strong>Cadres</strong> in the model. The function and format of each of
those sheets is described in more detail below.</li>
<li>
<strong>DeliveryModel</strong>: A text description for the
healthcare delivery model scenario. This is for user reference only and
does not change how the model functions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Geography_dontedit</strong>: Informational field that is
populated by the <strong>RegionSelect</strong> sheet. Do not edit here,
as it will not affect the functioning of the model but is automatically
used for naming the results files and may result in confusion if it is
changed manually.</li>

<p>* Truncated normal can be done in R using the truncnorm package.</p>
<p>We are approximating a Markov random walk with drift. The error term
is generally modeled with a normal distribution, plus an additional
drift distribution. Here we use just one parameter. There is some
evidence that a Weibull distribution is also a good option.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="popvalues">PopValues<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#popvalues"></a>
</h4>
<p>The <strong>PopValues</strong> sheet contains fertility and mortality
rates for different groups in the population. Fertility rates are
specified as births per woman per year and will add people to the
simulated population. Mortality rates are specified per individual per
year and will remove people. All rates (and rates of change) in the
model are stochastic; the value you specify is the mean in a
distribution and the variance is determined by the ‘p’ and ‘q’
parameters set on the <strong>StochasticParameters</strong> tab. The
first row, “Annual birth rate male,” is the fertility rate applied to
males (so it should always be set to zero); this is necessary for
running the model.</p>
<p>Columns A through F define standard categories and shouldn’t need to
be modified unless you plan to add functionality to the model itself.
Default values are sourced from Ethiopian DHS data but should be changed
for your context. If you look at the equation in each cell, you can see
that the data is being sourced from another sheet in the workbook.
However, the <strong>PopValues</strong> sheet is the one used as an
input to the model, so values can be changed directly here if you
prefer.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="parameters-2">Parameters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#parameters-2"></a>
</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Description</strong>: The human-readable demographics
category. This does not affect the model’s functionality and is for
readibility only.</li>
<li>
<strong>Label</strong>: The unique string that defines that
category.</li>
<li>
<strong>Type</strong>: The type of rate describes, mortality or
fertility.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sex</strong>: The sex to which the rate applies.</li>
<li>
<strong>BandStart</strong>: The youngest age to which the rate
applies.</li>
<li>
<strong>BandEnd</strong>: The oldest age to which the rate applies.
Note: Be sure that the population age bands do not overlap, or multiple
rates will be applied to the same people.</li>
<li>
<strong>InitValue</strong>: The rate value at the beginning of the
simulation.</li>
<li>
<strong>ChangeRate</strong>: The annual change in rate over the
course of the simulation. A value of 1 indicates no change, a value
above 1 indicates the rate is increasing over time, and a value below 1
indicates the rate is decreasing. For example, the age 15-19 initial
fertility rate of 0.072 will be 0.0712 (0.72 * 0.988469278) after one
year.</li>
<li>
<strong>ValueCode</strong>: The unique string identifying the

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="taskvalues">TaskValues<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#taskvalues"></a>
</h4>
<p>The <strong>TaskValues</strong> sheets describe the specific
healthcare tasks that are completed by the healthcare workers. The model
provides a reference sheet (<strong>TaskValues_ref</strong>) that lists
a comprehensive range of healthcare tasks, such as vaccination,
education about contraceptives, antenatal care, etc. You can down-select
the tasks included in your model by deleting rows on the reference sheet
and all other <strong>TaskValues</strong> sheets.</p>
<p>You can then provide one or more <strong>TaskValues</strong> sheets
that describe who receives and performs the healthcare tasks, how often,
and for how long. These sheets are specified as inputs to the model via
the <strong>Scenarios</strong> sheet. For example, by default there are
three <strong>TaskValues</strong> sheets: <strong>TV_Basic</strong> and
<strong>TV_Comprehensive</strong>. These are quite similar, but have
different subsets of tasks listed, to differentiate different delivery
model scenarios. You can set these sheets up to include whichever sets
of healthcare services you are delivering in the scenarios you want to
model. You could also have different healthcare services available for
different regions, which would require the creation of additional
<strong>TV_</strong> tabs.</p>
<p>Columns A through D are only for reference from the original data
source and are not used as inputs to the model. Columns G through I do
not affect the running of the model, but are used in the automatic
creation of summary statistics and can be used for manually
post-processing the results. Columns L through P jointly determine how
many resources are required for a given task by specifying how many
contacts with the healthcare system are required for a given task, how
long each contact takes, and the number of proportion of people that
received care.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="parameters-3">Parameters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#parameters-3"></a>
</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Indicator</strong>: A unique ID. For example, the indicator
FH.MN.ANC.1 indicates Family Health, Maternal and Newborn, Antenatal,
and first task. These can be set to any useful text (excluding special
characters), but each row must be a unique value.</li>
<li>
<strong>CommonName</strong>: The human-readable common name for the
task.</li>
<li>
<strong>ClinicalOrNon</strong>: Indicates if the task is clinical,
non-clinical, or non-productive.</li>
<li>
<strong>ClinicalCat</strong>: The sub-category for the task. These
can be any text value that is useful.</li>
<li>
<strong>ServiceCat</strong>: The sub-sub-category for the task.
These can be any text value that is useful.</li>
<li>
<strong>RelevantPop</strong>: The population to which this
healthcare task applies, selected via a drop-down menu. For example,
antenatal care is proportional to the number of births. Cervical cancer
care is proportional to the population of women of child-bearing age.
This value changes which population the task is applied to in the model.
Additional populations cannot be specified via the <strong>R Model
Inputs</strong> file.</li>
<li>
<strong>Geography</strong>: Automatically filled based on the region
specified in the <strong>RegionSelect</strong> sheet. Do not change this
column manually.</li>
<li>
<strong>StartingRateInPop</strong>: The proportion of the relevant
population that receives this care. For example, the value for antenatal
care visits is 1 because every new birth requires that care. This value
should not exceed 1.0.</li>
<li>
<strong>RateMultiplier</strong>: A multiplier to account for tasks
that happen in excess of the number of people in the eligible
population. For example, you would use HIV incidence rate as the
<strong>StartingRateInPop</strong> for HIV testing, but some proportion
of the people that receive tests do not have HIV. The proportion of true
negatives will be the <strong>RateMultiplier</strong> such that the
<strong>StartingRateInPop</strong> * <strong>RateMultiplier</strong> is
equal to the number of people who receive testing.</li>
<li>
<strong>AnnualDeltaRatio</strong>: The annual change in the
proportion of the relevant population who receives care. For diseases
declining in prevalence, this should be below less than 1.0
(e.g. childhood parasites). For diseases increasing in prevalence, this
should typically be greater than 1.0.</li>
<li>
<strong>NumContactsPerUnit</strong>: The number of contacts with the
healthcare system per person who is eligible to receive this task. In
the default example, four antenatal care visits per birth are
recommended.</li>
<li>
<strong>NumContactsAnnual</strong>: The number of contacts with the
healthcare system per person annually for this task. Used for routine
preventative care that happens on an annual schedule and isn’t based on
age or condition. Most tasks will have either a number of contacts per
unit or a number of contacts annual, but not both.</li>
<li>
<strong>MinsPerContact</strong>: The number of minutes required by
the healthcare worker to complete this task with an individual. This
value should typically range between 5 and 30 minutes.</li>
<li>
<strong>HoursPerWeek</strong>: The number of hours per week a
healthcare workers spends on a task, usually a non-clinical task that is
not directly related to population rates. For example, there may be a
few hours of weekly administrative tasks required, regardless of
clinical care provided. Community engagement, outreach, and supply
management may also be tasks with this dynamic.</li>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="seasonalitycurves">SeasonalityCurves<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#seasonalitycurves"></a>
</h4>
<p>The <strong>SeasonlityCurves</strong> sheet describes birth
seasonality and the seasonality of conditions like malnutrition, TB,
malaria, and diarrhea. Each month of the year is listed in a row and
each cell in a given column represents the proportion of those births or
conditions that occur in a given month. For example, in the
demonstration curves, you can see that malnutrition is highest between
September and January and lower the rest of the year.</p>
<p>The values in each column should sum to 1. If they don’t sum to 1,
the model will normalize the values; however, this may be a source of
unexpected behavior. If you see strange seasonal patterns, we recommend
verifying the sum of these values.</p>
<p>You can add seasonality curves for additional conditions if desired
by adding additional named columns. If you do so, you can then reference
them on the <strong>SeasonalityOffsets</strong> tab.</p>
<p>The <strong>SeasonalityCurves</strong> tab is referenced in the
<strong>Scenarios</strong> manager. If you want to run scenarios with
different seasonality curves, you can duplicate the
<strong>SeasonalityCurves</strong> tab, modify it, and reference the
different tabs in the <strong>Scenarios</strong> column M.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="seasonalityoffsets">SeasonalityOffsets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#seasonalityoffsets"></a>
</h4>
<p>The <strong>SeasonalityOffsets</strong> sheet contains a list of the
tasks that are affected by seasonality and how they are offset from
(occurring before or after) the seasonality curves. Offsets are
specified in months: negative values indicate the number of months prior
to the event described by the seasonal curve, positive values are after,
and values of zero indicate there is no time offset from the curve. The
name of the curve listed in this sheet must match the name of the curve
in the <strong>SeasonalityCurves</strong> sheet.</p>
<p>For example, antenatal care visits are related to birth seasonality
but precede those births by some period of time. The first round of
treatment for malnutrition will not have an offset from the malnutrition
seasonality curve, but followup visits occur at the 1, 2, and 3 month
offsets. The number of contacts with the healthcare system listed in the
offset table should match the number of contacts listed in the
<strong>TaskValue</strong> sheets for that particular task. In other
words, if four antenatal care visits are recommended, four offsets
should be listed in this sheet.</p>
<p>Up to six offset contacts can be specified in the model; additional
contacts would require updates to the model code. Note that the first
year of a simulation may show unreliable results due to positive
seasonality offsets not being carried forward from the prior,
unsimulated, year. For example, if you are simulating years 2030 through
2040, follow-up healthcare visits that take place in 2030 for
malnutrition diagnosed in 2029 will not be included. We recommend
ignoring the first simulated year if you expect this will be a major
concern. This edge effect is handled on the final year of the simulation
by running the model forward an additional year and adjusting for
negative offset tasks.</p>

<p>The <strong>Cadres</strong> sheets define the type of clinician
(community health worker, nurse, doctor, etc.) responsible for each type
of healthcare task. You may have one or more of these sheets for the
scenarios you are modeling. The cadre used for each scenario is defined
in the <strong>Scenarios</strong> sheet in the column
<strong>sheet_Cadre</strong>. It’s very important that every task value
unique identifier appears in the <strong>Cadres</strong> sheets because
otherwise the tasks will be unassigned and thus uncounted. If you have
unexpectedly low workload assigned to certain cadres of workers, this is
a possible source of the error.</p>
<p>For example, the default Ethiopian example has some tasks being
shifted from certain cadres of workers to other workers over time as
staffing shifts, and each scenario models this shift in responsibilities
slightly differently. The numbers and names of the columns can be
changed, but the must be consistent across all sheets and must use the
format of YY_CadreName where YY is the last two digits in a year, such
as YY=30 for 2030. The year represents the first year in which this
allocation is made; the allocation remains in place for the remaining
years unless an additional assignment is made.</p>
<p>The total column isn’t fed into the model, but is a visual check to
be sure the staff assignments sum to 100% correctly. If the total column
is above or below 100%, this will result in either under-assignment or
duplicative assignment of task time. If you have unexpected workload
assigned to certain cadres of workers, this is a possible source of the
error.</p>
<p>For example, in the <strong>Cadres_Comprehensive</strong> sheet, you
see the ANC visits start out as being solely the responsibility of the
Health Extension Workers (HEWs) and then shift entirely to a cadre of
new midwife staff members in 2025. A more complex example is the
Pneumonia (ARI) tasks, which start as the responsibility of the HEWs and
then gradually shift to the Health Officers, Family Health Officer, and
Nurses.</p>

</h4>
<p>The <strong>RegionalData</strong> sheet is the source file for all of
the regional data included in other sheets that is pulled in via VLOOKUP
in Excel. For example, the <strong>StartingRateInPop</strong> used in
the <strong>TaskValues</strong> sheet comes from the source values in
this sheet. If you want to retain the multi-geography structure
currently used in the model, we recommend changing the values here.
However, the model pulls from the sheets listed above, so you can also
change the values directly in those sheets.</p>

<p>The PACE-HRH model simulates healthcare needs in a given population
to enable better health system staffing decisions. The model is
configured via Excel sheets and run via an R script.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Close “R Model Inputs.xslx” in Excel. RStudio will be unable to
load the input values if the file is open.</p></li>
<li><p>In RStudio, open the “Run simulations.R” script.</p></li>
<li><p>From the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, select <strong>Install

<li><p>Under <strong>Install from:</strong>, select the most recent

<li><p>You may see a banner at the top of the screen that indicates some

enable installation.</p></li>
<li><p>In the R code, set <em>numtrials</em> to the number of
simulations you want to run. 100 tends to be good; higher values can
take longer because of the stochasticity in the model.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Run the script.</p>
<p>The results are saved out to a CSV file with the date and name of the
geography as specified in Excel in the filename. The console will beep
at you when the model has finished running.</p>
